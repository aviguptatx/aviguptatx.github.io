# NYT Mini Leaderboard

Site Link:
  - https://aviguptatx.github.io/

Current Features:
  - auto updates website once per day with new results
  - calculates and displays ELO (trueskill elo system)
  - also displays average time and rank, as well as number of wins and games played
  - displays history of all games played, paginated by year

Future Ideas:
  - update scoreboard more than once per day (but only update elos once per day)
  - separate saturday mini (which is longer) into different category
